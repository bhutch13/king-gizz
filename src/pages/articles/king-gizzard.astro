    <p class="mb-4">
You don't expect to discover your next musical obsession while heading to a baby shower, but that's what happened with me and King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard. Just 12 hours earlier, I'd been at a mind-melting Gesaffelstein house show, but it was my friend Jerm's absence that would prove more significant. He'd chosen a different musical journey that night - a promised three-hour King Gizzard epic in Austin. The next day on the way to the shower, Jeremy was still in a daze, "processing" what he'd witnessed. Between tie-dying tees and snacking, bits of his experience spilled out: psychedelic rock odysseys, synthesizers, maybe some satanic stuff, and the kind of musical mayhem that would naturally appeal to a Phish fella like him.

    I'd heard of King Gizzard before - they were one of those bands that kept surfacing in conversations, a persistent blip on my musical radar. Something about my friend's shell-shocked enthusiasm and the fact that they'd managed to pull two friends away from a rare Gesaffelstein show (another friend stayed in Houston to attend Gizz the next night) made me realize I needed to understand what I'd missed.

Jerm suggested starting with Flight b741, at the time their most recent and quote/un-quote approachable album. I took that advice initially started with their top five on Spotify just to dip my toes in the water before diving into an album. Two songs caught my ear...one was Le Risqué from Flight b741. Pure, powerful, (small) cocky 80s rock. The other was Phantom Island, a journey of a song [more description needed but not too wordy].

Two songs on repeat for a couple days…and I started inching deeper into the catalogue. With any new band, it’s nice to get a heads up from friends or Pitchfork or NME or whatever your trusted source is for a base point. Where do you start? Usually, you don’t need an “approachable” album. Usually, you go to a band’s top album, maybe they’ve got a classic to start with Tame Impala, one could start Currents. 

However, with King Gizz, a strategic approach is required. There’s a lot there. And not just in the mouthful of a band name - King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard - which I have fully repeated to my mom and others on several occasions. The intimidating factor here is a combination of the genre-spanning nature of their discography as well as the sheer volume of it.
