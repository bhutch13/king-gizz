    <p>
      You don't expect to discover your next musical obsession while heading to a baby shower, but that's what happened with me and King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard. Just 12 hours earlier, I'd been at a mind-melting Gesaffelstein house show, but it was my friend Jerm's absence that would prove more significant. He'd chosen a different musical journey that night - a promised three-hour King Gizzard epic in Austin.

    Jerm suggested starting with Flight b741, at the time their most recent and quote/un-quote approachable album. I took that advice initially started with their top five on Spotify just to dip my toes in the water before diving into an album. Two songs caught my ear...one was Le Risqué from Flight b741. Pure, powerful, (small) cocky 80s rock. 
    The other was Phantom Island, a journey of a song starting with light piano building in a horn and jazzy elements 
    and culminating with what can only be described as the sounds of the a battle cry as the horses
    chase you down on the battlefield. Or maybe that's just me :) Sounds almost like something from Led Zeppelin at this point.

Two songs on repeat for a couple days…and I started inching deeper into the catalogue. With any new band, it’s nice to get a heads up from friends or Pitchfork or NME or whatever your trusted source is for a base point. Where do you start? Usually, you don’t need an “approachable” album. Usually, you go to a band’s top album, maybe they’ve got a classic to start with Tame Impala, one could start Currents. 

However, with King Gizz, a strategic approach is required. There’s a lot there. And not just in the mouthful of a band name - King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard - which I have fully repeated to my mom and others on several occasions. The intimidating factor here is a combination of the genre-spanning nature of their discography as well as the sheer volume of it.

      Fully flying now, I went deeeeep on a Flight b741. Learning lyrics or the closest approximation of them all the way through from 
      Antartica to Hog Calling Contest to through Le Risque and finishing with the final "b 7 4 1" on Daily Blues. I was fully enthralled.

      I even took away some mantras from the music I like to live by in my life, like -  
      <br><br>
      "Death to me is a life lived Safely"

      Feeling comfortable with enough with one album to branch out, and dying to avoid a life lived safely I stepped further into the King Gizz realm. 
      Targeting a few more albums based on the recommendations of friends:
      <br><br>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
        <li>Ice, Death, Planet, Lungs, Mushrooms, and Lava (2022)</li>
        <li>Omnium Gatherum (2022)</li>
        <li>Butterfly 3000 (2021)</li>
      </ul>
