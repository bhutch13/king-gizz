Welcome to my blog! This is my first post.

## King Gizz Rough


I knew of King Gizzard, but it wasn't until the weekend of November 18th, 2024 that I entered their orbit. That Friday I was attending a Gessafelstein house show (mindbogglingly niiiiice) with a group of friends. 

One friend opted out of the Gessy show. He had to stay in Houston because he’d purchased tickets for King Gizzard that Saturday night and couldn’t miss it [interview Sean?]. Another friend, Jeremy, decided not to join us because he was attending the show in Austin, TX the same night as Gesafelstein. Jeremy was somewhat new to King Gizzard but promised something special out of a promised 3 hour epic set. Already a big Phish head this dude was onboard. The next day, Jeremy and I attended another friend's baby shower. Jeremy was "still processing" the show most of the day. Psychedelic, rock, and maybe some satanic stuff? Alright I'm intrigued.

Jerm suggested starting with Flight b741, at the time their most recent and quote/un-quote approachable album. I started with their top five on Spotify. Two songs caught my ear...one was Le Risqué from Flight b741. Pure, powerful, (small) cocky 80s rock. The other was Phantom Island, a journey of a song [more description needed but not too wordy].

Two songs on repeat for a couple days…and I started inching deeper into the catalogue. With any new band, it’s nice to get a heads up from friends or Pitchfork or NME or whatever your trusted source is for a base point. Where do you start? Usually, you don’t need an “approachable” album. Usually, you go to a bands top album, maybe they’ve got a classic to start with [example here? LCD Soundsystem self-titled maybe?]

However, with King Gizz, a solid approach is required. There’s a lot there. And not just in the mouthful of a band name - King Gizzard and the Wizard Lizard - which I have fully repeated to my mom and others on several occasions. It’s about the genre-spanning prolific (and I mean pro-lif-fic) discography of this band.

King Gizzard is striking because of their prolific discography. During the band’s XX year tenure they have twice released five albums in a year. Including one October in 20XX when they released 2 albums in a single month. 

To put it in perspective, fellow Australian band Tame Impala has released YY albums in that timeframe. Kevin Parker, the lead man and auteur behind Tame Impala, is notoriously detailed in his production style. However, even if we consider Taylor Swift - another notable artist for the amount of work put out - she only clocks in at ZZ albums in the King Gizzard Era. 

[working title] sonic diversity genres and instruments
One band, XX members, and God knows how many instruments. The Gizz are agnostic in their worship of sound. From one song to the next you could hear a harmonic [Flight b741 song], 12 string citar, custom MOOG synthesizer or ravishing drums. Sometimes all in one song. 

The soundscape they create is what’s truly iconic to me. Switching from Phantom Island to Shanghai to Le Risque will have your head spinning as you question whether your listening to the same band as well as your existence in this cosmos. 

And what’s even more special about this is that these are not just one off songs! Entire albums are arranged around these soundscapes. Butterfly 3000 for example lives heavy in the world of the synth, envoking some Asian and thoughtful undertones. 

Flight B741 screams Glam rock to me. Big BIG production, heavy drums, bravatto on the lead singer like you wouldn’t believe. After watching the music video for Le Risque, I had to immediately put on The Darkness classic - I Believe in a Thing Called Love. Lead men in each band are definitely hitting different notes and at a little different vocal ranges. But in my mind - Gizz Lead singer Stu Mackenzie embodies the same flamboyant over the top swagger as Justin Hawkins of The Darkness.
